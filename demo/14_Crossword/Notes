There is a semi-standard online format for storing crossword puzzles,
with a *.puz suffix.  The format is described (well,
reverse-engineered) here:
    http://code.google.com/p/puz/wiki/FileFormat
There is a fixed-length header, 
a variable-length section with the answer to the puzzle along with the black squares,
and the questions.

More specifically, the fixed-length header is 52 (0x34) bytes long.  These
include some useful fields: 
  At byte 0x2C, that byte is the width
  At byte 0x2D, that byte is the length

Assuming width W and length L, there are 2LW bytes defining the
crossword (one copy with the answers, followed by one copy with
blanks, to store partial state).
