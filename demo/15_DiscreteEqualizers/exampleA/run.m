%% Basic example for an equalizer

%% Model: X_i, i=1..n are generated from [-1;1] with probability 1/2
%% (BPSK modulation)
%% Observations:
%% Y_i = a_1 X_{i-1} + a_2 X_i + a_3 X_{i+1} + N(0,\sigma^2)
%% Goal: from measurements Y_i, find most likely values for X_i

%% Equalizer is loopy, so does not give MAP performance
%% Observations Y_i do not explicitely appear in the model:
%% they are 'demapped' (i.e. incorporated into a factor function)

%% This is the simplest approach, but it requires creating a new factor
%% graph for each set of observations, so it's too slow.
