% Given three texts t1,t2,t3, represented as ASCII streams, suppose
% we only observe the XOR of any pair of texts.  Our goal is to recover the
% original texts from the XORs.  To make life easier, we cheat and reveal
% every 'hint_rate' byte.  'prob_trigrams' is a matrix listing
% probabilities of the most common trigrams.  It's culled from Google's
% n-gram data and has some weird features (only a-z,A-Z,"."," ", and it
% tokenizes such that periods are always separated by white space on both
% sides).
