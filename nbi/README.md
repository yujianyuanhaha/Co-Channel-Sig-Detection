# Overview
* Time domain narrowband interference mitigation (signal of interest is single-carrier signal with linear modulation) - needs data sheet also;  
*  Frequency-domain narrowband interference mitigation (same signal of interest) - needs data sheet also

## sigal of interest
* bandwidth signal, single carrier, OFDM
* RC pulse shaping

## signal of non-interest
* narrowband, here single tone

## method
### 1) time domain
* FIR filter, truncated impulse response 
    * ZF
    * MMSE
    * LMS
    * RLS

### 2) frequency domain
* threshold filter

### 3) narrowband parameter estimation

# Further Work
* DS-SS
* UWB
* OFDM
