Dimple version 0.06 release notes
==================================

* Dimple is now built with Java 7 and requires MATLAB 2013b or later.

Projects using Dimple will have to be using a version of the Java JVM of at least 1.7. Because MATLAB 2013b is the first version based on Java 7, at least that version will now be required.

* Added support for generating and handling events

* Added built-in factors Multinomial, MultinomialUnnormalizedParameters, and MultinomialEnergyParameters

* Added built-in Poisson factor
