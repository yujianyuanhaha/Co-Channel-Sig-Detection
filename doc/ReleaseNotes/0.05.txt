Dimple v0.05 Release Notes
==========================

Significant New Features Since v0.04 (Oct 5, 2013)
------------------------------------
* Added junction tree solvers

* Merged Gaussian solver into the SumProduct solver, using Gaussian-parameterized messages for continuous variables in the SumProduct solver

* Added generic sampling-based approximate message computation for factors connecting to at least one continuous variable that do not otherwise support exact Gaussian message computation

* Added ExchangeableDirichlet factor function

* Added MultivariateNormal built-in factor function

* Added Multiplexer factor function

* Added MatrixProduct, VectorInnerProduct, and MatrixRealJointVectorProduct built-in factor functions, and corresponding use cases for the overloaded * operator in MATLAB

* Added RealJointSum, RealJointSubtract, and RealJointNegate built-in factor functions, and corresponding use cases for the overloaded + and - operators in MATLAB

* Generalize finite field custom factors to factor functions that can be used with any solver (retaining performance benefit when using SumProduct solver)

* Added Java solver template to aid in the design of new solvers

* Modified Java model package structure

* Added dimpleVersion MATLAB function


Significant Bug Fixes Since v0.04
---------------------------------
* Fix performance problem in tree scheduler for large graphs

* Fix performance problem for large deterministic-directed factors

* Adding continuous variables to a graph (Real, Complex, or RealJoint) no longer requires changing the solver first (since the default SumProduct solver now supports continuous variables)

* Fix support for including constants when adding custom built-in factors

* Fix Score method support in SumProduct solver for graphs with continuous variables

* Fix tree scheduler to support forests
