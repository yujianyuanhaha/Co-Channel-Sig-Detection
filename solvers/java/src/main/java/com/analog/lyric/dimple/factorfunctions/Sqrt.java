/**
 * Deterministic square root function. This is a deterministic directed factor
 * (if smoothing is not enabled).
 * 
 * Optional smoothing may be applied, by providing a smoothing value in
 * the constructor. If smoothing is enabled, the distribution is
 * smoothed by exp(-difference^2/smoothing), where difference is the
 * distance between the output value and the deterministic output value
 * for the corresponding inputs.
 * 
 * The variables are ordered as follows in the argument list:
 * 
 * 1) Output (square root of input)
 * 2) Input (double or integer)
