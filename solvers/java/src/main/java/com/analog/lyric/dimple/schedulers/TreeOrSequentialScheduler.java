 *         If this graph is a tree, or any of it's sub-graphs are trees, this
 *         class generates a tree-schedule. Otherwise it generates a sequential
 *         schedule on the portion of the graph that is not a tree.
 * 
 *         This scheduler respects any schedulers already assigned to
 *         sub-graphs. That is, if a sub-graph already has a scheduler
 *         associated with it, that scheduler will be used for that sub-graph
 *         instead of this one.
